I recently setup a APC SC1000 UPS, APC includes a USB to serial cable, but when trying to connect it to a linux machine, and configure it with apcupsd, I had issues.

Since the connection is neither USB, or serial outright, apcupsd can't communicate to the UPS.

	# use lsusb to find the details of the serial adapter to create a udev rule

	~$ lsusb | grep Serial
	Bus 003 Device 002: ID 067b:2303 Prolific Technology, Inc. PL2303 Serial Port


	# based on the output from lsusb add a rule to /etc/udev/rules.d/local.rules

	~$ cat /etc/udev/rules.d/local.rules
	#Bus 004 Device 002: ID 067b:2303 Prolific Technology, Inc. PL2303 Serial Port"
	ENV{ID_BUS}=="usb", ENV{ID_VENDOR_ID}=="067b", ENV{ID_MODEL_ID}=="2303", SYMLINK+="apc-usb"

	##########

	# set /etc/apcupsd.conf to use the new device
	~$ head /etc/apcupsd.conf
	UPSCABLE smart
	UPSTYPE apcsmart
	DEVICE /dev/apc-usb

	##########

	# After a reboot check the status of the UPS using
	~$ sudo apcaccess status
